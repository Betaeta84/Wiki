## Improving the Documentation
For the time being, these Wiki pages are the place for MeerK40ts documentation - and at the time this paragraph was written these pages are relatively disorganised, very variable in terms of coverage, target audience (novice, intermediate, expert), level of detail, quality and structure.

**ANY** help you can give to enhancing the documentation will be very gratefully received. So if you can't find the help you need, or if you find that what is already written is unhelpful, misleading or just plain wrong, then once you figure it out please give us some of your valuable time and improve the documentation for those following you by giving us the benefit of your own experiences.

Wiki pages are written in [Github flavoured MarkDown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) which is **very** easy to learn.

Some guidelines for editing wiki pages are provided [here](./Tech:-Creating-a-wiki-page) - please read these before you make any edits.

## Language Translations
MeerK40t is written by an English speaking developer (as a Brit I say that loosely because it is North American English rather than English English) so the default UI is in English. But the code has been written so that all the English words can be replaced by their French / Spanish / Italian / etc. 
equivalents, providing that all the translations are provided in a language file.

And this is where ***you*** come in...

There are only two steps to creating a new language translation:

1. Regenerate the list of strings that need translating
2. Edit the file for your language and provide a translation for each string

Simples!! Full details can be found [here](/meerk40t/meerk40t/wiki/Tech:-Foreign-Language-Translations).

# Sponsorship
If you are:

1. using MeerK40t for commercial gain (and there is nothing wrong with that), and
2. unable to give your time to any of the above activities

then please consider [sponsoring @tatarize](/sponsors/tatarize) as a way of saying thank you to him for all his efforts. 

This software is free to use and there are no licensing or legal terms which compel you to reward @tararize in this way, and the choice is yours to make freely - but it just seems ethical to share a small proportion of your profits with him when you benefit financially from his efforts.
