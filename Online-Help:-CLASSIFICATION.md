# Classsification
The assignment of an element to a laser operation is called classification. It determines how this element will be burnt: as a vector, as an image, with a lot of power, fast / slow etc. All these properties are set by the [operations](https://github.com/meerk40t/meerk40t/wiki/Online-Help:-OPERATIONS).

There's no limit to the amount of operations a single element can be assigned to:
- a single operation, like engrave or cut
- multiple operations, a rastered image of the element as it has a solid fill and a vector cut around it's edges
- consequence: **if an element is not assigned to any operation at all, then this element will not be burned!**
