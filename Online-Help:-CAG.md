These buttons will take two or more elements and create a new shape based on some operations:
We start with these two shapes:

After selecting these and applying the operations we get:
- Union: Welds the two shapes together taking the outer edges

- Difference: We subtract one shape from the other: the second selected shape will be subtracted from the shape selected first

- XOR: a single shape containing all lines of the selected shapes will be created:

- Intersection: The common area of the two shapes will be created
