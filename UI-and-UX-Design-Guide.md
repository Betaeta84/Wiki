## Color Blindness

Under no circumstances should color be the only indication of the state of something.

See: [https://uxdesign.cc/color-blindness-in-user-interfaces-66c27331b858](https://uxdesign.cc/color-blindness-in-user-interfaces-66c27331b858)

We should never, for example, use grey and blue and their color as the only method of figuring out whether something is a raster or a vector.
