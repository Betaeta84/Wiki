## Running MeerK40t

You can run MeerK40t either from a self contained executables (for Windows 32-bit or 64-bit, MacOS, OSX, Linux, Raspberry Pi 32-bit or 64-bit) or you can run from the Python source code (perhaps on other platforms if the drivers are available).

Most people tend to run from a self-contained executable if there is one for their platform.

### Precompiled Binaries

The precompiled binaries are available from https://github.com/meerk40t/meerk40t/releases

In most cases, it should be as simple as downloading the binaries and installing them using the normal facilities of your operating system.

**Notes:**
1. Precompiled Binaries do not have the translations for other locales/languages working very effectively. However at present there are no comprehensive translations available, so this may not be an issue. **But if you want to contribute** by working on translations, this might change.
