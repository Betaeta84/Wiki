"Before a full release, at least one of us needs to confirm pause/unpause, and estop functionality on the big 3 laser platforms. Additionally, a successful vector and raster burn. That's my bare minimum condition I'm imposing for good measure." -- tiger12506


Tiger tests are performed on physical machines before a full release. This is intended to be a bare minimum condition set to make sure we didn't break anything or our basic functionality has any issues. These are not intended to be hard to pass but a sanity check to make sure we didn't accidently break a laser.
