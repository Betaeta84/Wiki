# Welcome to the MeerK40t Wiki!
MeerK40t is the extendable laser software for the Stock K40. We hope that you find this **free** software useful, and hopefully not to difficult to learn to use (though we know there is scope for improvement in both the software's usability and the documentation - and we hope that you may be willing to help out with these).

## Overview
Meerk40t is a replacement for both the software supplied with the K40 and the K40 Whisperer software.

## Manual
See the Manual: [MeerK40t Manual](https://github.com/meerk40t/meerk40t/wiki/MeerK40t-Manual)

## Help Wanted

@Sophist points out that whilst @taterize (David Olsen - the author) is doing a great job in creating this useful tool, there is always more work to do than he can handle alone. So, if you benefit from using this **free** software, please, please show your appreciation by contributing something back and helping him out. 

If you are worried that you will be unable to contribute because you can't write Python code, then let me reassure you that there are many other ways you can contribute. Updating and enhancing these Wiki pages to pass on your experiences to others, or (if your primary language is not English) translating the application strings into other languages are also contributions. Raising Github issues when things don't work as you think they should and suggesting ideas for other improvements also help things along. And finally testing out new functionality on your machine and helping with research into the capabilities / speeds etc. of the controller board are also a great help.

If you wish to help translate, you may need to regenerate the messages.po file:

* [Regenerating the message.po file](https://github.com/meerk40t/meerk40t/wiki/Tech:-Foreign-Language-Translations)

If you wish to write a module either for public consumption or for private use:

* See the [Kernel API System](https://github.com/meerk40t/meerk40t/wiki/Tech:-Kernel-API-System) Documentation.

If you wish to write GUIs for your modules, you may need to add icons.
