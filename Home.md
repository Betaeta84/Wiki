# Welcome to the MeerK40t Wiki!
MeerK40t is the extendable laser software for the Stock K40. We hope that you find this **free** software useful, and hopefully not to difficult to learn to use (though we know there is scope for improvement in both the software's usability and the documentation - and we hope that you may be willing to help out with these).

## Overview
Meerk40t is a replacement for both the software supplied with the K40 and the K40 Whisperer software.

## Detailed Documentation for the Stock Board.

If you want detailed documentation for the stock board this is the place to be. The only place to be.
[Understanding Lhymicro-GL](https://github.com/meerk40t/meerk40t/wiki/Tech:-Lhymicro-GL)

[Lhystudios Boards Hardware specifics](https://github.com/meerk40t/meerk40t/wiki/Tech:-Lhystudios-Hardware-specifics)

This is also a place for research on the board:
[Physical Speed Measurements](https://github.com/meerk40t/meerk40t/wiki/Tech:-Physical-Speed-Measurements)

## Help Wanted.

You can contribute, even if you can't code. Raising issues and suggesting ideas is certainly making contributions. Also, things like translating the strings into other languages is strongly desired and helpful. Running test your machine and helping with the research on the board or into particular subjects closely related.

If you wish to help translate, you may need to regenerate the messages.po file:

* [Regenerating the message.po file](https://github.com/meerk40t/meerk40t/wiki/Tech:-Foreign-Language-Translations)

If you wish to write a module either for public consumption or for private use:

* See the [Kernel API System](https://github.com/meerk40t/meerk40t/wiki/Tech:-Kernel-API-System) Documentation.

If you wish to write GUIs for your modules, you may need to add icons.
