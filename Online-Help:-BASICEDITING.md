## Clipboard Functions
If you have selected elements on the scene, then MeerK40t allows you 
- to delete them 
- to cut them, ie to move the selected elements into the clipboard
- to copy them, ie to put a copy of the selected elements into the clipboard
- to paste the entries in the clipboard back on the scene

## Undo/Redo
Modifications to elements and operations can be undone (and reapplied if you recognised that an undo operation was not the thing you were looking for).
