# Installing from source

Download Python if you do not already have it installed: https://python.org
Be sure to check the box to Add to Path when it comes up during install.

In the command line console: `pip install meerk40t[all]` then `meerk40t` should launch meerk40t.

# Notes
* Installing numpy on windows 7 requires installing numpy==1.23.5. `pip install numpy==1.23.5` if you're using 32 bit python.

### Compatibility
We currently support Mac, Linux, and Windows back to Windows 7. To use Meerk40t in windows 7, you may need to install python 3.8 and, if using the 32-bit version, use `numpy==1.23.5`.
