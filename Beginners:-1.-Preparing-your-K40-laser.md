## Safety matters
Once you have physically unpacked your K40, it may be tempting to plug it straight into the mains and get lasering - but for a raft of reasons this is not advisable, and can even be dangerous or even deadly.

We cannot provide the answers to all the issues here - but we do want to give you at least a heads up on the things you need to do to stop your K40 from electrocuting you, burning out your eyes, damaging itself or just disappointing you with very poor results.

### Electrical Safety
The build quality of K40s can be extremely variable. So before you plug your K40 into the mains here are a few pointers that you need to check:

#### Laser voltages
The CO2 lasers operate on **EXTREMELY** high voltages - voltages that are quite high enough to stop your heart - and the capacitors in the K40 power supply can retain a charge for quite a considerable time after you turn it off / disconnect it from the mains. ***Please exercise a great deal of caution when you are approaching the high voltage parts of the electronics.***

#### Wiring connections
People report that the wiring inside the K40 can be poorly connected - I certainly found several wires not properly tightened when I received mine. So before plugging it in, follow all the wires and ensure that all the terminals are securely tightened.

#### Earthing
It is **essential** that your K40 is earthed properly - both to avoid accidental electrocution if the metal chassis accidentally becomes connected to the mains or laser voltages, but also because the lifetime of your laser can be shortened considerably if it is not earthed properly.

If you are using the K40 in a country where every plug has a properly grounded earth pin, that is usually quite sufficient as a basis - but if not (and if you have any doubts, get an electrician to check it) then you need to install an earth spike close to your K40 and connect it to the earth connection on the rear.

And you should check that the earth connection on the rear has not been insulated from the chassis by paint - unscrew it, scrape off the paint around the hole and screw it back again.

#### High voltage connections
Please check the high voltage wires to the laser tube carefully - ours were fine, but many people have reported poor quality connections.

#### Analogue current meter
Whilst we are talking about wiring, if you have a K40 with an analogue mA meter then great, but if not you should really consider buying one and wiring it in. In order not to shorten the life of your laser you need to keep the current below xx mA. However, the digital power display on those K40's that have it indicates a theoretical % of total power (the K40 laser is usually a 35W laser despite the name), and this % is extremely misleading as it bears little relationship to the laser power actually generated. Those people who have installed these alongside the digital display say that a power level of 30% on the digital display can reach this maximum current, and that higher levels can **substantially** shorten the life of your laser tube. So, if you don't have a mA meter to tell you the real power, then please do not use your K40 above (say) 30% unless you want to keep shelling out for a new laser tube.

(I cannot say for certain whether this was the case for my own K40, but I was running in early days at 80% on the digital display, and I didn't get more than an hour's burn time before the tube failed - I cannot say whether these were related, but I did need to get a replacement laser tube under warranty.)

### Fumes
The toxicity of the fumes from your K40 will depend on the material you are lasering, but some materials can be really quite toxic, whilst others are just unpleasant. There are few, if any, materials you can laser completely safely and pleasantly without having a means of extracting the fumes to where they can dissipate without you breathing them in.

The supplied extractor fan is generally considered to be inadequate - and because it is fitted to the back of the laser, it creates positive pressure in the exhaust pipe to the outside and any leaks in that pipe will result in fumes entering your workroom. We added a second in-line fan at the far end of the exhaust tube to create negative pressure in the tube and prevent this.

### Cooling
Most K40s come with water pipes and some form of water pump, but don't come with any water tank or means of cooling. It is **essential** that you keep your laser tube reasonably cool during use (generally recommended between 5C and 20C), and because water expands when it freezes you need to ensure that the water in your laser tube doesn't freeze or it will crack the glass.

Our K40 came with a digital temperature display on the main panel (using a thermistor taped to the cooling water exit tube just outside the business end of the laser). I am not quite sure whether it is better to measure the output temperature (showing how hot it was in the laser tube) or the input temperature (which shows whether your cooling water is already too hot to be able to cool the laser enough), or indeed how accurate the temperature measurement is when the thermistor is simply taped to the **outside** of the pipe, but in the end I decided that this was probably a good enough indicator and didn't need enhancing.

It is also essential that the water you use is non-conducting - and that means using deionised water. (We get ours in 5litre bottles from our local LIDL store at c. 70c per bottle. For a tank we use a  40l storage box with two holes drilled in the lid. We live in a warm climate, so freezing is not an issue - for cooling we use ice packs from our domestic freezer. But many people use technology to cool their water.) You may also need to add a non-conducting anti-algae chemical to the water.

Finally, once you have your cooling water system working, you will need to tip your machine to get the air bubbles out of the laser tube - rotating the tube so that the water pipes are entering / leaving the laser at the top can also help avoid bubbles.

### Protecting your eyes
Depending on the strength of your burn and the material you are lasering, your burn will create a **bright** spot on the work. Even with the lid down and the "protective" window in the way, this bright spot can **still** damage your eyes. And this is **not** even the laser light itself, just light from the effect it is having on the material it is hitting. You certainly do NOT want to get the laser light itself shining into your eyes - even as a reflection - or to put your body parts in the way of the laser.

Some people add a protecting microswitch to the laser compartment lid, but personally I have found this idea to be very limiting when e.g. you are trying to align the laser etc. 

But please, please, get some laser safety specs (suitable for CO2 lasers) and wear them when you are lasering.

### Risk of fire
TODO

## Burn quality
The light as it exits from your laser is a very narrow and very, very straight beam of invisible light. It is reflected off 3 mirrors and goes through a lens to focus it before it hits the material in a tiny spot of concentrated light. There are quite a few things that can cause this to go awry:

1. Mirror / lens cleanliness
2. Laser / mirror alignment
3. Lens orientation
4. Focus
5. Smoke

### Mirror/lens cleanliness
When your K40 arrives, and before you align the mirrors you should clean the three mirrors and the lens with rubbing alcohol or acetone - when my K40 arrived these were filthy and had obviously never been cleaned. If you are doing this before aligning mirrors, you can unscrew the retaining rings and take the mirrors out to clean them fully. After alignment use a cotton bud to clean them.

The smoke from your burns can make them become dirty again quite quickly - cleaning them needs to be a fairly regular activity.

### Laser and Mirror alignment
The idea is that regardless of where the laser head of your K40 goes to on the bed, the laser light should enter the head in exactly the same position and angle - and to do this you need to have the laser itself and the three mirrors aligned. Once you understand the procedure it is actually not that difficult, but it is an essential part of your laser setup.

TODO: Research and add a link to the best instructions on the internet on aligning the laser / mirrors.

If you are a visual learner, here is a video on youtube: [The Short K40 Laser Alignment Video](https://youtu.be/6Bcgo-CoBAs)

In essence the steps are as follows:

a. Put tape on the 1st mirror near the business end of the laser and adjust the laser position so that (very short) bursts of the beam (on very low power) hit the mirror approximately in the centre.

b. Put tape on the 2nd mirror that moves front-to-back with the gantry. Move the gantry to the back and adjust the position of the 1st mirror so that the beam hits the mirror, then move the gantry to the front of the machine and see if the spot moves. Adjust the angle of the 1st mirror both horizontally and vertically so the spot stays the same when the gantry is at the back and the front. Hopefully it will be in the centre of the 2nd mirror, but you may need to adjust the position of the laser, the mounting base of the 1st mirror or the mounting base for the 2nd mirror in order to get it to stay the same and be approximately in the centre of the 2nd mirror.

c. Put tape on the opening on the moving head where the laser beam will enter and adjust the angle of the 2nd mirror both horizontally and vertically so that the spot stays in the same position. If the spot is not in the centre of the opening you may need to adjust the position of the head on the gantry slider or the 1st/2nd mirror or laser to make it approximately central.

d. The 3rd mirror (clipped into the head itself) is typically not adjustable.

e. The lens in the bottom of the head is typically not adjustable.

### Lens orientation
The K40 lens is flat on one side and convex on the other, and the direction that it is fitted inside the laser head **is** important - **it needs to be curved side upwards**.

### Focus
Whilst the laser beam is a narrow parallel beam of light (i.e. it stays the same width as it travels away from the laser), it is not small enough to burn material really effectively. So the K40 has a lens at the bottom of the head (held in with a screw on circular retaining plate) to focus the laser beam to an even smaller dot.

On the stock K40 there is a specific distance below the laser head where the laser is finely focussed into a tiny dot. Higher or lower than that distance, the spot will be bigger and less concentrated.

The height of the bed that your material sits on will obviously need to be lower than that distance by the thickness of the material you are working with - and if you use different materials of varying thickness, then the height of the bed needs to vary to match.

To call the bed that comes with the K40 "useless" would be being kind. It is a fixed height bed (👎 for being fixed height) with a rectangular opening (👎 for this being much, much, much smaller than the laser area, 👎 for being able to drop materials through the hole), one side of which is a spring loaded clamp (👎 for the clamp being useless).

TODO: Picture of stock bed here.

Some people have come up with elaborate means of varying the focal distance by mounting the lens in a moveable carrier. (TODO - add a link.) A lot of people use a variable height bed to achieve the same thing.

I never bothered even to try using it, and replaced it with an adjustable height bed of my own design built using a few bearings and a 3d printer belt off the internet, a few 3D printed parts and some steel / aluminium (aluminum for our American cousins) profile from the local DIY superstore.

You can also use a choice of beds. A solid bed is not generally considered a good choice because there is no gap below the bottom of the material and you can get charring when you cut through. Alternatives are grill (pre-shaped fine grating), knife (multiple parallel vertical bars) and pin (multiple vertical pins) to support the material - the lower the contact area, the smaller the chance of . Which one is best for you will depend on the materials you are going to use and how flexible they are - the more floppy, the more support you need.

### Smoke
The extractor fan(s) will create some air flow across the bed front-to-back, but this is not typically string enough or even enough to consistently and quickly remove smoke from the burn area (where it can disperse the laser beam) and keep it from dirtying your mirrors and lens. 

You should consider installing air assist and / or smoke assist, and possibly improving the default air flow front-to-back by enlarging the air openings in the front of the lid (or propping the lid slightly open) or even adding additional fans and air ducting inside the lid.

TODO: Summary of options / advice / links on where / how to buy / make the best air/smoke assist. 

### Reflection charring
When you are cutting, once you have cut through the laser beam can reflect off the bed surface (grill, knife, etc.) back onto the underside of the material and char in those areas that are resting on the grill.

I have bought some spray black stove enamel paint and intend to paint my bed surface with this to see if it prevents these reflections.

## Other issues
### Holes in the bottom of the K40 case
I discovered after the event that there is a largeish hole in the bottom of the K40, and when you have burned through your material the laser can carry on down and through the hole and char the surface of the table that your laser is sitting on. I riveted an air grill across this hole.

### Casters
My K40 came with casters - which is IMO a pretty dumb thing to do with a piece of equipment like this that you really don't want rolling off the edge of the table it is sitting on. So the first thing I did was replace them with M10 furniture feet from my local DIY superstore.

## Other potential enhancements
### Camera
MeerK40t has the ability to use a camera installed in the lid of your K40 to help you position material in the right place to cut. 

TODO: Someone who has done this and who has the experience needs to write this section.

## Charring
Not so much an enhancement, but this seems to be a suitable place to mention that when lasering materials prone to charring - in my case plywood and leather - I have used a spray bottle to spray water onto the surface of the material. A thin sheen of water seems to have little effect on the laser strength but does massively reduce charring and/or flames.
