## General

MeerK40ts standard to load / save data is the svg-Format (supported by many tools like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)). While it is supporting most of SVG functionalities, there are still some unsupported features (most notably advanced text effect, clips and gradients).
To overcome that limitation MeerK40t can automatically convert these features with the help of inkscape:
if you set the 'Unsupported feature' option you can either ask at load time how to proceed or let inkscape perform the conversion automatically. Please note that this conversion might not really needed most of the times, so the recommendation is to use the 'Ask at load time' option.
