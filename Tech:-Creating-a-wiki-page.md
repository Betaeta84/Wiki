If you are reading this, then hopefully you have decided to help us with the MeerK40t documentation by creating a wiki page.

Wiki pages are written in [Github flavoured MarkDown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) which is **very** easy to learn, so please read that linked page first.

Creating a new wiki page is easy: You click the `New Page` button at the top right of all Wiki pages.
Editing an existing wiki page is easy: You go to the page you want to edit and click the `Edit` button at the top right.

### Rules
Rule 1: Please use your own good judgement about the edits you make. We are grateful for your help and trust that your heart is in the right place.

Rule 2: **Please do not delete any existing content without checking with the project team first.** But please feel free to restructure and relocate content if you think that makes sense.

Rule 3: Please try to follow the Wiki page naming conventions in order to help keep the page list in some sort of sequence. Additionally, if you need to, please add a link to your new page to any higher-level index pages or the sidebar etc. to make your new page visible to users.

Rule 4: Please use inline links to other pages. i.e. "[Click here](./)" rather than "Click here: (https://...)". URLs to other wiki pages should look like this: `./Tech:-Creating-a-wiki-page`

Rule 5: Please add your own userid to the list of authors that should be at the bottom of each Wiki page (or add it if it doesn't already exist). The standard text is:

> # Authors
> The MeerK40t team is grateful for the help from @xxxxx, @xxxxx and @xxxx in creating this page. If **you** think it can be improved still further, please feel free to edit the page and add your userid to this list. ðŸ˜ƒ 

### Authors
The MeerK40t team is grateful for the help from @Sophist-UK in creating this page. If **you** think it can be improved still further, please feel free to edit the page and add your userid to this list. ðŸ˜ƒ
