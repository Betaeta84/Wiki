# Camera
MeerK40t supports multiples USB-cameras: a camera can be used to help supervising a job or to simplify the positioning of material on the laserbed and the proper positioning of elements within your design.

The camera button in the toolbar will let autodetect cameras and let you choose from up to 5 cameras.

You can calibrate your picture within the camera panel by setting the 4 corner circles to the outer corners of your laserbed:
