Before you start doing **anything** with your K40 Laser, we strongly recommend that you read this page about safety.

CO2 laser cutting machines can be extremely dangerous to your health if you are not careful. The laser tubes operate on extremely high voltages that can kill you outright. The laser beam can blind you almost instantly if the laser beam is reflected directly into your eye. Fumes from some materials can be highly poisonous.

**BUT if you are careful** about understanding the risks, about how you commission and maintain it and how you use it, your K40 can be safely used as intended.

This wiki page has been written to give you a basic understanding of how your K40 could potentially harm you - as forewarned is forearmed.

Once you have read and digested this page, the next page in the Beginners Tutorial will show you how to [prepare your K40 laser](./Beginners:-2.-Preparing-your-K40-laser) to ensure that it is safe to use and to help you get quality results from your usage.

**We strongly advise that you DO NOT USE YOUR K40 LASER until you have understood this page and made all the safety checks on the next wiki page.**

## Electrical Safety
Whilst you may get a nasty shock from the mains voltage in your house (at 240V or 110V), providing that it is a short shock (e.g. where you jerk your hand away - rather than a continuous shock because e.g. you cannot let go of the wire) this is most unlikely to kill you, particularly if you have a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCD) in your mains installation.

However, your K40 CO2 laser operates using **an ionising voltage of between 14,000 and 20,000 volts** and this is quite high enough to stop your heart and kill you if you get shocked by it. Furthermore, your K40 power supply has capacitors in it that can retain this high voltage for some hours after you turn it off / disconnect it from the mains, and before these have discharged you can still get a shock from a voltage high enough to kill you. So please be **very, very careful indeed** when you are approaching the high-voltage areas of the K40.

It is also essential that the metal chassis of your K40 is properly earthed so that if the chassis somehow becomes connected to these extremely high voltages, you will not get a lethal shock simply by touching the chassis.

Not quite so vital but still important, many people report that their K40 arrived with the wiring inside poorly connected - I certainly found several wires not properly tightened when I received mine.

However, providing that you ensure that you are careful when poking around in the wiring, and providing that you check that the wiring is safe, you can definitely ensure that your K40 is electrically safe.

## Protecting your eyes
The CO2 laser tube in your K40 produces a very narrow laser beam of infra-red light which is normally completely reflected onto the work material by the three mirrors in your K40. However if something interrupts this beam and reflects it into your eyes - or even if your material is shiny and reflects only a part of the beam into your eye - you can be blinded almost instantly. If you want to see some examples of how short a pulse of laser light is needed to cause major damage, take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wXApAAh8xA).

During operation the tube also produces non-laser light in other frequencies including ultra-violet which can shine out from the tube in many directions and also reflect off the laser mirrors.

Depending on the strength of your burn and the material you are lasering, your burn will create a **bright** spot on the work. Even with the lid down and the "protective" window in the way, this bright spot can **still** damage your eyes. And this is **not** even the laser light itself, just light from the effect it is having on the material it is hitting. 

However, providing that you take proper precautions to protect your eyes, your K40 can be used safely without risking your vision.

## Fumes
Some materials burn with unpleasant fumes. Other materials can give off genuinely toxic fumes - so you should research your materials to make sure that you know the risks. Either way you do **not** want to be breathing these fumes.

The extractor fan supplied with your K40 is generally considered to be inadequate - and the flimsy plastic exhaust tube to be so sub-standard as to be useless/potentially dangerous.

But if you understand the materials you are burning and upgrade your exhaust extraction from the poor quality exhaust system supplied with the K40, your K40 can be used without risk of poisoning yourself (and without obnoxious but non-poisonous smells also).

## Risk of fire
Laser cutting/burning only works because the laser is hot enough to burn or melt/evaporate the material. Usually the exposure to the level of heat to do this is brief enough and local enough not to cause a major fire (though it is common to experience excessive charring from localised flames around the laser beam) - but clearly there is a risk that the material might get too hot and burst into flames. If for any reason your laser head stops moving whilst the laser continues to operate (because something jams or the stepper motors stop working), a fire can easily start which can then spread to the rest of your home. **The risk of fire** from a machine specifically designed to burn things should not be ignored.

These risks can be mitigated by:

* Checking the free movement of your rails each time before powering on your K40
* Fitting a fire suppression system inside your K40 (such as the [Kordo strips](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086LKHCC4))
* Fitting an automated thermal electrical cut-off (see [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_cutoff))
* Fitting a domestic smoke alarm above your K40
* Always remaining with your K40 whilst you have a burn in progress
* Ensuring that your K40 has an Emergency Stop Button / Off switch and regularly test that it is working
* Have a properly maintained CO2 fire extinguisher close at hand
* Keep a spray bottle of water to hand to supress small flames that may char your material (and which might grow into a major fire)

With sensible precautions, your K40 can be used without risk of a fire burning down your home.

## Burns
Whilst being burned by your laser may instinctively seem to be a high risk (or perhaps the highest risk), a laser burn may be painful but is much less likely to create major long-lasting health issues or death. 

Nevertheless, given that the light from your K40's laser tube is invisible infra-red light, you do need to be careful that your clothes or body parts do not interrupt the laser beam.

With basic precautions (like ensuring that the lid is always closed) you should be able to use your K40 without risk of burns.
