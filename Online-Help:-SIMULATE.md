# Simulation

The simulation window allows you to preview the expected burn results: sequence of operations, durations etc.
It allows to fiddle with optimisation parameters and get an insight if and to what extent certain optimisation options would speed up the burn process.

Optimisations: If you click on the button with the Arrow left indicator (<img src="https://github.com/meerk40t/meerk40t/assets/2670784/7da3759d-a85e-4d0d-8b3f-d62c27a24fa6" width="25">), then a panel with optimisation options appear. You can change them and click "Recalculate" to assess the impact these will have. You will find details about the optimisation options here: [Optimisation options](https://github.com/meerk40t/meerk40t/wiki/Online-Help:-OPTIMISATION)

Tip: You can zoom in and move around the scene preview by using the mouse scrollwheel as you can do in the main scene.
