# Non-comprehensive list of changes since first release of 0.8

## Regmarks
You will recognise that there is a new node in the tree called 'Regmarks':

![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/172069842-f5c0523c-1784-4903-b9f0-87b60f833585.png)

You can either drag and drop elements in the tree into or out of this new area or use the context menu to move them in:

![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/172069878-f2e1afed-923c-4ff5-a5c6-9202aa2dd97d.png)
or out:

![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/172069904-e3c4daf2-2bf8-4651-851b-6ed6d75453ca.png)

Elements in regmarks will *not be burned at all*, therefore they are ideal to act as a visual guide i.e. registration mark (regmark) for other elements.
Notabene: if you mark an object as Reference object and move this then to regmarks, you can very simply align other elements to this regmark:

![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/172069997-a37d8769-be8e-40f4-bb5e-9e560b8e0d4b.png)

## Extended Item-Manipulation

<img width="170" alt="Manipulation rectangle" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/158456969-b6c8884e-575d-46c9-902a-d216dc737de1.png">

### Manipulation
<img width="170" alt="details" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/158457574-a777c932-bdec-46f7-8896-a26627e08970.png">

- You have 4 corner handles to allow simultaneous resizing in X- and Y-direction (marked red in the picture above)
- You have 4 side handles to allow sizing in either X- or Y-direction (marked blue)
- You have 1 center handle to allow moving  (marked green)
- You have two handles on the bottom / on the right that allow skewing in X- or Y (marked orange): if you click on one of the skew-handles, then you can skew the element(s) between -90° and +90° in X- or Y-direction respectively

<img width="130" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/158611995-4bee70bc-4cb3-483f-a4e5-d9b5f3c19259.png">

You can immediately create a copy of your selected element if you press the alt key while starting the move:

![copy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/159351857-a8e8bdaf-d583-4fde-8694-ca39a47ae1bb.gif)

### Rotation
<img width="167" alt="Rotation" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/158457981-4226d9d4-a7ba-42d7-8d4d-5d7f1793867b.png">

In addition there is a rotation indicator at every corner. if you click on the rotation symbol then you can rotate the element(s) around their center.

<img width="132" alt="corner" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/158458400-c90a5555-458f-4593-b0e2-81bce5138ebf.png">

There is a secondary rotation option if you click just inside the corner then a rotation will take place around the opposing corner.

<img width="132" alt="corner_color" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/158459378-6e5df084-13f7-4763-91fd-311daaf94585.png">
So: 

- Click on the green area: rotation around center
- Click on the blue area: rotation around opposing corner
- Click on the red area, the handle itself: sizing as described above.

While the default rotation is around the center of an object you can define the rotation center (which is by default to the center position with any new selection):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/159337799-63cf0328-0249-480b-acca-8615bf42234c.png)

You an drag this indicator around to allow for custom rotations which would otherwise very difficult to achieve:
![rotcenter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/159339355-c99624e9-629e-4c17-b94f-4b31ec0a416c.gif)

### Reference Object
In addition you do have an indicator whether this element works as Reference-Object 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/159335481-8e125158-c543-4734-8c1c-9a8775cc95ae.png)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/159336304-54edbe8a-3888-40c0-a86f-8fd3168b2ecc.png)

![reference1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/159347966-41efe431-b1f4-42c3-98fa-f20a2bda5ebe.gif)

With such a reference object established you can move and scale elements relative to it via the context menu (right mouse-click):

<img width="202" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/159348396-c046497f-8852-45be-80ea-1647fa2ccf2a.png">

<img width="274" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/159348295-b156af87-aa6e-4070-bf73-981b4961d7ab.png">

 ![reference2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/159351297-ed0d001c-9360-450e-90a2-3f8c4fe2523a.gif)

Usecase: Use a rectangle, circle or whatever shape as template for multiple burn tasks.

### Options

If you don't need skew or rotate or get confused by the handles you may turn these on/off via some check-boxes in the statusbar. (I did not want to use more valuable screen estate)

<img width="262" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/159336527-9f240422-1b40-451d-81de-543dbd1e3edf.png">

This is especially useful if you want to show and manipulate the rotation center: turn off the move handle to see the rotation center indicator:

<img width="218" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/159336879-62f55a18-ecbf-463a-abda-a6e912aa5a6e.png">

## Grid, Magnet-Lines, Snap-Points

### Magnet-Lines
There is a new functionality now to quickly align elements: magnet-lines. You are creating them by double-clicking on the ruler-area (and if you click on that area again then the line will be removed).

![magnets](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/161030963-fb73907c-bdb0-47dc-b0da-b9b207025dbe.png)

Whenever you move an element (group of elements), if you move it close to a magnet line then the selection will be attracted to it: the left side, the center or the right side for a vertical magnet line, the top side, the center or the bottom side to a horizontal magnet line.
(You can overrule this behaviour if you press the shift-key while moving - then there will be no position adjustment at all).

The "Strength of the attraction" (i.e. how close does a border need to be influenced by a magnet line), can be changed on the fly by using the combobox in the statusbar just right to the regular manipulation-options):

![attraction](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/161031054-e38d0cc6-b2d9-4407-9230-e5ca765e251b.png)

You can have as many magnet-lines as you want. You can get rid of all of them if you dbl-click on the units indicator (left top side of the screen) or if you use the context-menu on the rulers. If there weren't any magnet lines then a magnetline for every grid line will be created instead.

![magnet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/161031110-016eb860-7321-4a11-a074-f64effb0a589.gif)

NB: the method for creating a magnetline by double clicking on the ruler area will focus on full tickmarks (i.e. grid lines) and the middle of two adjacent grid lines. If you need something finer, then just zoom in into the scene, this will permit finer positioning of the magnet lines.

### Snap-Points
Introduce a functionality to snap the cursor to either grid points or relevant points on elements.

<img width="118" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/162281288-788b3ecf-dde2-4b5e-a4e3-106e2f7bef06.png">

![magnet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/162281706-f6519c3a-062b-48e1-9cf9-e570797b103a.gif)

![magnet2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/162281967-cba97b4b-42b5-4333-ac28-d7a6b71dd0e8.gif)

While you are moving your mouse when having selected a element-creation tool (i.e. intentionally not the 'Regular Scene' tool), you will see neighbouring points of interest being displayed and highlighted if they would be become a snapping target):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/162396185-0008ab2e-a432-46c7-af59-ea1e1c3fee95.png)

NB: the snapping behaviour will be ignored if you press the shift-key, in this case the current mouse-position will be considered.

### Additional Grid-Types
#### Command 'scene grid'
A new 'grid' command in the scene-context to allow a secondary rectangular grid with optional scaling and shifted origin (main use case rotary) as well as a circular grid (mainly for Galvo).
![circ_grid1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/167685047-c6e777c2-0885-4a85-b52b-dcdd8c8d8dc9.gif)

![circ_grid2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/167685072-b7c179df-8827-41d7-9d94-9834ec45c666.gif)

```
scene grid
```
displays the current parameters, e.g.
```
[20:04:09] scene grid
[20:04:09]     Grid-Parameters:
[20:04:09]     Primary: On
[20:04:09]     Secondary: On
[20:04:09]        scale-x: 3.00
[20:04:09]        scale-y: 1.50
[20:04:09]     Circular: On
```

```
scene grid primary
```
toggles the primary grid

```
scene grid secondary <cx> <cy> <scalex> <scaley>
```
toggles the secondary grid and sets the center to \<cx\> \<cy\> and the scale compared to the regular coordinates.
**NB: if you dont provide any parameters then the scale defaults to that in the rotary settings**

<img width="128" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/167471286-bc2c8843-69b1-42b5-9ff5-51710a0e259a.png">

```
scene grid circular <cx> <cy>
```
toggles the circular grid and sets the center to \<cx\> \<cy\>

A simplified method of accessing the commands is via the contextmenu over the guide area:

<img width="144" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/167469844-3792ef2c-f6ce-44dd-9851-91230d978325.png">

Noteworthy:
- You may abbreviate primary, secondary and circular with p, s and c respectively
- If you omit the additional parameters for center and scaling, then the center defaults to that of the primary grid and the scale to 1.0

#### Color scheme:
There are some more commands to set the colors of the elements:
- Primary grid: scene color set guide #000000 , scene color set grid #000000
- Secondary grid: scene color set grid2 #A0A0A080 , scene color set guide2 #000000
- Circular grid: scene color set grid3 #A0A0A080 , scene color set guide3 #A0A0A080

### Context-Menu in Simulation-Pane
![simul_grid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/172014115-5890639a-ff64-4417-b3af-2e84cc760e16.gif)

## Editing, Selection, Quick-Color...
a) allow shift-click selection of an element to add it to the existing selection instead of selecting it solely
b) provide an option to draw selection handles outside of the bbox to provide better visibilty to smaller elements (might need default transparency still):

<img width="165" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/164399105-9d0c1181-98df-4479-bd07-a9fa16cc40c4.png">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/164399638-d0ffbfa5-3df2-4371-b36f-a5e38c4cabfe.png">

### Allow individual mass changes
Extend the functionality of the position panel to allow mass-changes of width / height / X / Y

![position](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/166329328-28c8d971-bf6f-430a-a291-4f214b11bb8c.gif)

### Element-Manipulation
#### Allow simultaneous sizing of opposing sides/corners
If you click ctrl+shift while resizing then the resizing operations will affect opposing sides / corners simultaneously allowing a resize operation with the center remaining unchanged:

![resizing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/163138637-745a8cf0-9610-4152-9eb0-172a8e451ea8.gif)

### Single-Click-Selection
Allow two fundamentally different single-click selections:
- left-click - choose the smallest element under the mouse-cursor
- ctrl+left-click - choose the largest element under the mouse-cursor
This default behaviour can be toggled under preferences:

<img width="353" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/170845136-3db1a97f-25ad-4e9e-a1de-63280e569857.png">

### Quick Color-Selector for stroke and fill
Addition of a quick color selector for stroke and fill (including reclassification) and an option to change the stroke-width:
![colorbar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/163574558-a898aeea-0dee-4d7e-a572-cde4613b3985.gif)

Left click on the color will change the stroke-color of all selected elements, right click the fill-color.
![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/163574606-6b931e9d-a736-4164-827a-2468d67155da.png)

You may change the stroke-width for the selected elements as well:
![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/163670677-597e655f-09c2-4096-b7d4-5d04c0bc7583.png)

You may turn this feature off in preferences:
![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/163574664-91dab832-bb3c-43d6-8477-1ae02f9dd1a5.png)

The tool remembers the last used colors for stroke and fill for the creation of new elements:

<img width="600" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/171034277-847ee1db-d98a-443d-8704-6fb7926b6ccc.gif">

## Tools
### Support for Line-Cap + Line-join
Recognises SVG stroke-linecap and stroke-linejoin attributes 
Adds linecap and linejoin commands:
```
[21:39:50] help linecap
[21:39:50]     	linecap <cap:str>
[21:39:50]     	(elements) -> linecap -> (elements)
[21:39:50]     	Argument: str 'cap':
[21:39:50]     		Linecap to apply to the path (one of butt, round, square)
[21:39:50]     	Option: str ('--filter', '-f'):
[21:39:50]     		Filter indexes
[21:39:57] help linejoin
[21:39:57]     	linejoin <join:str>
[21:39:57]     	(None) -> linejoin -> (elements)
[21:39:57]     	Argument: str 'join':
[21:39:57]     		jointype to apply to the path (one of arcs, bevel, miter, miter-clip, round)
[21:39:57]     	Option: str ('--filter', '-f'):
[21:39:57]     		Filter indexes
[21:39:57]     
```
### Fill-Rule attribute
Acknowledge fill-rule attribute:

<img width="375" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/170742198-8b823a7f-7f58-4496-87ea-bf8cbf112084.png">

New command: fillrule

### New Area-Tool
#### Additional tool to measure (a polygon)
Line lengths and contained area.
![measure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/165288203-9dd63105-6fc1-4fd1-a56a-507752784852.gif)

#### area-Command
With the new _area_ command you will get information of the covered area of an element:
![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/165368900-03c8fe50-8841-4b6a-bd50-ed82b91498f7.png)

You can also use the command to resize the object that it covers a desired space:
```
area 
(elements) -> area -> (elements)
Option: area ('--new_area', '-n'):
    provide a new area to cover
```
Notabene: the value you provide, e.g. 6cm is actually consired to be 6**cm²**

![area](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/165369107-47b6eee4-8297-4ae7-a2e1-3065d79d6ac1.gif)

## Text-Elements

### Text-Entry
Extended the Text-Tool (a simple textentry so far):

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/169061015-1a03acc9-c7b9-4e9c-b837-039cb0fc663d.png">

### Limited Support for SVG-Font-Attributes
E.g. the famous wiki-svg-file (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Test.svg) looks now:

<img width="290" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/168773425-c62b5c64-72b0-461c-90c1-546fabd30899.png">

- The text bboxes take now the font-attribute descent into consideration:
<img width="316" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/168772191-0183c1ab-43ae-44bf-a358-5754d73388a1.png">

### Wordlist

#### wordlist commands
```
[01:37:31]     --- wordlist Commands ---
[01:37:31]     add             add value to wordlist

[01:37:31]     set             set value to wordlist
```
#### Switching between variable-view and regular view
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/169625106-ccaaaa9f-6937-4857-b5b3-e8ca2cdf97a7.png)

#### User defined formats for date and time
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/169625022-6d0e1de3-b9c3-46b5-8975-d179cb893814.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/169625040-405d742e-456b-44bb-8420-40c2ffd12554.png)

See [python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes) for available format codes

#### GUI-Editor
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/169625175-4e394951-7a4a-41ae-add5-cf4e16d4ed42.png)

##### Editing
You may delete or add a new wordlist pattern by using the Add text/AddCounter/Delete Buttons and you can edit individual (content) entries by slow-clicking on the relevant value:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/169625253-24af6767-8706-459b-b53a-783472bf5a6e.png)

##### Import of csv-files and using indexes and offsets
First of all you can import a CSV-file:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/169625307-00109c98-db27-43d3-801f-4f96cea5bf51.png)

This will add corresponding wordlist entries with all their content of the file associated to them:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/169625353-ddf28132-a310-467c-a056-c5908fb843fc.png)

The index-value corresponds to the active dataset in the csv-file (highlighted by a red text entry in the right content-grid)
So the usage of {data} in the above example will use the active entry (in our case the "2")
You can add additional data from the next row, the row after that etc. by using the "#+num" modifier:
{data} provides you with the current dataset
{data#+1} with the next entry
{data#+2} with the one after that
and so on.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/169625956-953f0892-286e-4e00-b131-0e72f817f28f.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/169626011-71735eaa-4756-47dd-896d-8aca23680d24.png)

You can also use {data#-1} which will give you the previous entry, or if you omit the "+" or "-" in front of the shift-number, then this will be considered the entry from exactly this row: {data#4} will give you always the value from the 5th row regardless where the current index resides (notabene the index is deemed to be zero-based).

If you would change the index for instance to "5" (i.e. the 6th row in the csv-file) then all textboxes will update accordingly:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/169626171-f511579b-4bb9-4ed8-af52-c79778233c90.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/169626185-f168d986-95ae-4038-98ba-bdb7926825ff.png)

##### Saving and loading of a wordlist
You can backup and restore your wordlist:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/169626216-66936c1c-9a1b-4beb-9009-3dfd347a87f4.png)

### Lasertools
Introducing a new tool (Menu Panes-Tools-Lasertools) to simplify the positioning of (circular) objects on the laserbed.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/163152156-35ce7e3a-bf52-43eb-9fc5-473be244fe80.png)

Use case: place blank, round coaster template on laser and properly place your graphic on it.

You can work with round blanks, then mark (with help of your laserpointer or the camera) three points on the circumference of the circle and MK will either recreate the circle for you (e.g. to act as a reference for further manipulation & orientation of other objects) or move the laserhead to the very center of the circle.

- Not yet as useful (but keep tuned, align on reference object will honor rotated objects in the future) is the tool to create a square: mark two points on one side of the rectangle on the bed and another one on the adjacent side: then MK wil create a square for you that can act again as basis for further alignment and manipulation.

- Add an additional option to lasertools:

just mark opposing corners and meerk40 will create the frame between the two (not awfully difficult I know). Together with the reference - feature you can then align / move any selection to this frame. If necessary the selection will be autorotated to fit better:

## General GUI-Changes
### Configurable color scheme
Nearly all colors used in the scene by different gui elements are now configurable:

<img width="421" alt="Colorful scene" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2670784/162995439-3b99907f-f594-4da3-b754-69c2cd5eeae6.png">

Syntax: you can specifiy the colour for an element by providing a color_code for it: 
- either as a hex representation in the format: #RRGGBBAA with RR the 2-digit hexvalue for the red component, GG for the green component, BB for the blue component and AA for the transparency (00 invisible to FF fully opaque))
- or as 'regular' colorcode: yellow, green, red, blue...

```
scene color <aspect> #RRGGBBAA
```
The following elements can be user-colored (aspect):
- manipulation - The manipulation rectangle 
- manipulation_handle - plus modification elements
- laserpath - The laserpath
- grid - Grid-Lines
- guide - The guide on top / to the left of the scene
- background - The background beyond the bed
- magnetline - Magnetlines
- snap_visible - Color for visible snap-indicators
- snap_closeup - Color for snap-indicators that would be used
- selection1 - Color for regular selection rectangle (left to right)
- selection2 - Color for selection rectangle (right to left)
- selection3 - Color for selection rectangle (inverting status)
- bed - The bed background

If you want to reset a single color to its default value then provide:
```
scene color <aspect> unset
```
if you want to reset the complete color-scheme:
```
scene color unset
```

### Lock the selection to the laser position
If you right click on one of the alignment buttons then the laser will move to the indicated position of the selected elements (regular click behaviour so far), but from then on the selection will remain at its relative position to the laser head, so if you move the laser then the selection will follow the movement. This behaviour ends when you either right click the same button again (laser head remains at its current position) or do a normal click of an alignment button (laser head will move).

The current lock state will be indicated by highlighting the button (visually not extremely appealing but a clear indicator).

NB there might be some limits to this when it comes to manual physical movement of the laserhead.
### Laserpath appearance
Additionally the laserpath has become less obtrusive and therefore easier to distinguish from regular elements.
