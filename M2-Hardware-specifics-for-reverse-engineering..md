The board is hooks the CH341A usb communications chip in parallel port mode to the LHY730318 chip running a MCS-51 instruction sets using an 8051 processor.

It is believed all the usb communications deal directly with the CH341A and the data is merely sent to the processor to perform the microcontroller actions.
